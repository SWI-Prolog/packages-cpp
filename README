			SWI-Prolog C++ interface

Demo:		make (must be GNU-make) produces

		* embedded program likes.  See likes.cpp
		* test.so, load using test.pl holding the examples from
		  the manual and some more.

Note:		I'm an amateur C++ programmer.  Volker Wysk <post@volker-wysk.de>
		has compiled a new C++ interface and announced it for
		first public testing on January 14, 2002. This interface
		may be downloaded from.
